    Examples (format matches schema):

    Repo:
    "CLI that cross-posts your blog posts to Dev.to, Hashnode and Medium; manages canonical URLs; adds UTM; syncs updates."

    Expected JSON:
    {
      "scores": [
        { "list": "self-marketing", "score": 0.8, "why": "Publishing & cross-posting are personal promotion workflows." },
        { "list": "productivity", "score": 0.4, "why": "CLI automation helps, but promotion is the primary goal." },
        { "list": "learning", "score": 0.0 }
      ]
    }

    Repo:
    "Task-runner that automates image optimisation and builds; speeds up local dev commands; no publishing features."

    Expected JSON:
    {
      "scores": [
        { "list": "productivity", "score": 0.9, "why": "Developer time-saver for day-to-day workflows." },
        { "list": "self-marketing", "score": 0.1, "why": "Not focused on promoting an individual." },
        { "list": "learning", "score": 0.0 }
      ]
